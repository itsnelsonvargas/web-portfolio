# Styling Not Loading - Debug Guide

## Problem
The deployed app on Render shows unstyled content - CSS/Tailwind styles are missing.

## Root Cause
The Vite-built assets (CSS/JS) aren't loading properly in production.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dockerfile with Debug Logging

Added logging to track the build process:

**Frontend Stage:**
- Shows when build starts
- Lists contents of `public/build/` after build completes
- Alerts if build directory wasn't created

**Final Stage:**
- Verifies build assets were copied
- Shows manifest.json contents
- Alerts if files are missing

### 2. What to Check in Render Logs

After deploying, check Render logs for these sections:

#### A. Frontend Build Stage
Look for:
```
Building frontend assets...
Build complete. Contents of public/build:
total 16
drwxr-xr-x ...
-rw-r--r-- ... manifest.json
drwxr-xr-x ... assets
```

**If you see:**
- `ERROR: Build directory not created!` → Vite build failed
- Missing manifest.json → Build incomplete

#### B. Final Stage Verification
Look for:
```
Verifying build assets...
total 16
-rw-r--r-- ... manifest.json
drwxr-xr-x ... assets
{
  "resources/css/app.css": {
    "file": "assets/app-xxxxx.css",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

**If you see:**
- `WARNING: Build assets missing!` → Assets weren't copied
- Empty or missing manifest → Problem with the copy step

## Deploy and Test

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
cd /c/Users/user/Desktop/web-portfolio
git add Dockerfile .dockerignore
git commit -m "Add debug logging to Dockerfile for asset build"
git push origin production
```

### Step 2: Watch Render Logs

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Watch for the build stages

### Step 3: Analyze the Logs

**Scenario A: Build succeeds, assets are there**
```
✅ Build complete. Contents of public/build:
✅ Verifying build assets...
✅ manifest.json shows the files
```
→ The issue is with Laravel not loading them correctly
→ **Solution:** Check environment variables (APP_ENV, APP_URL)

**Scenario B: Build fails**
```
❌ ERROR: Build directory not created!
```
→ Vite build is failing in Docker
→ **Solution:** Need to debug Vite configuration

**Scenario C: Build succeeds but copy fails**
```
✅ Build complete. Contents of public/build:
❌ WARNING: Build assets missing!
```
→ Multi-stage copy isn't working
→ **Solution:** Docker layer issue

## Common Fixes

### Fix 1: APP_ENV Not Set to Production

In Render Dashboard → Environment:
- Ensure `APP_ENV=production`
- Ensure `APP_URL=https://nelsonvargas.onrender.com`

When `APP_ENV` is not `production`, Laravel's `@vite()` helper behaves differently.

### Fix 2: Asset Manifest Not Readable

The manifest.json needs to be readable by the PHP process.

Check in entrypoint script logs:
```
[5/7] Optimizing application...
php artisan config:cache
```

If this fails, the issue might be permissions.

### Fix 3: Vite Build Needs More Files

If the frontend build fails, it might need additional files. Check package.json scripts:
```json
"build": "vite build"
```

This should output to `public/build` by default.

## Testing Locally with Docker

Before deploying, you can test the Docker build locally:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t portfolio-test .

# Check the build logs for our debug messages
# Look for "Building frontend assets..." and "Verifying build assets..."

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e APP_ENV=production \
  -e APP_KEY=base64:test-key-here \
  -e APP_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  -e APP_DEBUG=false \
  -e DB_CONNECTION=sqlite \
  portfolio-test

# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

If it works locally but not on Render, the issue is environment-specific.

## Expected Outcome

After the fix, your deployed site should:
1. ✅ Load with full Tailwind styling
2. ✅ Show the polished design from your local version
3. ✅ Have working animations and interactions
4. ✅ Console (F12) shows no errors about missing CSS/JS

## What's in the Logs

### Success Path
```
Step 4/20 : FROM node:22-alpine AS frontend
Step 5/20 : WORKDIR /app
Step 8/20 : RUN npm ci
Step 12/20 : RUN echo "Building frontend assets..."
Building frontend assets...
vite v5.x.x building for production...
✓ built in XXXms
Build complete. Contents of public/build:
manifest.json
assets/

Step 15/20 : FROM php:8.2-fpm-alpine
Step 20/20 : COPY --from=frontend /app/public/build
Verifying build assets...
-rw-r--r-- manifest.json
drwxr-xr-x assets
{ "resources/css/app.css": { "file": "assets/app-CebTE0tC.css" ... } }
```

### Failure Path (Example)
```
Step 12/20 : RUN echo "Building frontend assets..."
Building frontend assets...
ERROR: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
ERROR: Build directory not created!
```

## Next Steps Based on Logs

1. **If build succeeds**: Problem is with Laravel/environment config
2. **If build fails**: Problem is with Vite/npm dependencies
3. **If copy fails**: Problem is with Docker multi-stage setup
